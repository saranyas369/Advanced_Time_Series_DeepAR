ADVANCED TIME SERIES FORECASTING PROJECT REPORT
=============================================

1. INTRODUCTION
---------------
This project focuses on advanced time series forecasting using deep learning models.
The objective is to predict future values of a time series while capturing uncertainty,
and to compare deep learning approaches with traditional statistical baselines.

The project implements a probabilistic DeepAR model on a multivariate time series dataset,
along with visualization and evaluation metrics.

2. DATASET DESCRIPTION
----------------------
A synthetic but realistic multivariate daily time series dataset was generated.

Features used:
- target       : Primary time series to forecast
- temp         : Exogenous numerical variable (temperature-like signal)
- promotion   : Binary external event indicator
- lag_1       : One-day lag of target
- lag_7       : One-week lag of target
- holiday     : Indian public holiday indicator

Lag features and calendar effects were included to capture temporal dependencies
and seasonality patterns.

3. DATA PREPROCESSING
--------------------
- Missing values created by lag features were removed
- Data was structured in time order
- Features were fed directly into the DeepAR model
- No data leakage was introduced

4. MODEL ARCHITECTURE
---------------------
DeepAR was implemented using an LSTM-based architecture.

Model characteristics:
- Input: Multivariate time series
- Hidden Layer: LSTM
- Output: Mean (mu) and standard deviation (sigma)
- Likelihood: Gaussian

This allows probabilistic forecasting instead of point predictions.

5. TRAINING PROCEDURE
---------------------
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss Function: Gaussian Negative Log-Likelihood
- Epochs: Configurable via config.json
- Training performed on CPU

The model learns both trend behavior and uncertainty over time.

6. EVALUATION METRICS
--------------------
The following metrics were implemented:
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

These metrics quantify prediction accuracy.

7. VISUALIZATION
----------------
Two key visualizations were generated:
1. Forecast vs Actual plot
2. Probabilistic uncertainty band (mean ± 2σ)

These plots help visually assess forecast accuracy and uncertainty.

8. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
------------------------
The DeepAR model successfully learns the temporal structure of the data.
Uncertainty bands widen during volatile regions, indicating realistic confidence estimates.
Lag features and promotion effects significantly influence predictions.

9. CONCLUSION
-------------
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of probabilistic deep learning models
for time series forecasting. Compared to traditional approaches, DeepAR provides
uncertainty-aware predictions and handles multivariate inputs effectively.

10. FUTURE WORK
---------------
- Add real-world datasets
- Extend to multi-step horizon forecasting
- Incorporate SHAP visualizations
- Compare with Prophet and SARIMAX in detail
